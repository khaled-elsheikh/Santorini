# Santorini
Santorini is a two or three-player strategy board game released in 2004 by Gordon Hamilton. Each turn of play involves moving one of your two pieces around a 5-by-5 grid each turn and then placing a tile adjacent to the moved piece, building up that spot of the board. On subsequent turns, pieces may be moved onto one of these built-up tiles, but only one level up at a time. Pieces may also be moved down any number of levels. The primary winning condition is to get one of your pieces onto level three (which would normally be four tiles high as the normal game set starts with a 5-by-5 grid of level 0 tiles). If your opponent is unable to move at all, this is also a win. Instead of placing a normal tile, you may also choose to place the special dome tile on top of a spot that is already at level 3. This would prevent any player from moving onto or building up that spot again for the remainder of the game
